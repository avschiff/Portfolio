    "From my P2 to my P3, I figured out how I was going to present my data story in my tool. Based on the information from P2, I decided it was plausible to create a histogram (plot_histogram function) to predict how many movies and TV shows will be presented to the user prior to scrolling down and seeing the actual list. Also, I noticed that it would be interesting to add more inputs to change the user's output based on more things than just genre. Therefore, I added an input of lowest rating and film type. To complete my data story, I thought it was important to use a cartopy map (plot_flight_path function) to display the flight path. After learning cartopy for P2, I knew it would be something that could add to my final project."
